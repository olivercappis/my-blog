# <My Blog>

## Description

This project was my first time creating an interactive website with multiple pages fully from scratch. I got to implement and learn a lot of skills including using jQuery to select and create HTML elements. It was also my first time using local storage. I was able to gain experience both writing to and reading from local storage to make the inputs given by the user on the form page available to the actual blog page. It was a fun excercize with lots of opportuity for me to dive into debugging my JS code and become more capable of breaking down what exactly is being accomplished and how the code it doing it.

## Usage

All that you have to do to use this blog site effectively is make sure that you fill out all three input fields. If you don't you will be given an alert to do so. Also be aware that since this is a static site and all of your input it stored in your browser's local storage you will only have access to your past posts within the same browser you created them.
